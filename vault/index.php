            <p class="card-text">Aaron Ward, owner of Webrex Hosting, has been banned from mc-market for asking a fourteen-year-old for nudes. He made an attempt to ban evade, which failed, just like his many other attempts: including, Webrex Hosting, which has been down for multiple days. He has been losing clients faster than Voxility creates hosts, and is known to be using suicidal thoughts, depression, and a feeling of a failed investment as an excuse to keep his host open. While the validity of his depression is not verified, it is clear he is using it as an excuse to continue to create new discord and forum accounts in order to bother members of our communities.

        <p class="card-text">A well-known scam, CubikNode transformed from a once thriving host to a 2-star 'poor' rating on trustpilot because of well over a dozen reports of scamming. The CEO has vanished and has left his clients with nothing.</p>
